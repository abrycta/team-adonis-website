                <p>The government pursued the zero-to-ten point socioeconomic agenda at the start of the Duterte administration in 2016 to help us achieve the Ambisyon Natin 2040, a vision that reflects the Filipino people's collective aspiration to end extreme poverty by 2040. WeThey have set a medium-term goal of lifting six million Filipinos out of poverty by 2022. In 2018, this was accomplished four years ahead of schedule.</p>
                <p>This early success in reducing poverty was driven by prudent macroeconomic management and the implementation of a number of reforms that increased people's real income opportunities. These include, among other things, the comprehensive tax reform program, which increased real income and funded more social services and infrastructure, the Build, Build, Build program, which helped create millions of jobs, and the Rice Tariffication Law, which reduced rice prices and inflation.</p>
