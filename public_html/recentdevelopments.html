                <h4>Local</h4>
                <p>The government pursued the zero-to-ten point socioeconomic agenda at the start of the Duterte
                    administration in 2016 to help us achieve the Ambisyon Natin 2040, a vision that reflects the
                    Filipino people's collective aspiration to end extreme poverty by 2040. WeThey have set a
                    medium-term goal of lifting six million Filipinos out of poverty by 2022. In 2018, this was
                    accomplished four years ahead of schedule.</p>
                <p>This early success in reducing poverty was driven by prudent macroeconomic management and the
                    implementation of a number of reforms that increased people's real income opportunities. These
                    include, among other things, the comprehensive tax reform program, which increased real income and
                    funded more social services and infrastructure, the Build, Build, Build program, which helped create
                    millions of jobs, and the Rice Tariffication Law, which reduced rice prices and inflation.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4>International</h4>
                <p>In foreign countries, China and India lead in terms of terminating poverty. China stated that it had
                    eradicated extreme poverty in December 2020. A more recent success tale is India. In 2019, 77
                    million people, or 6% of the world's population, lived in poverty thanks to robust economic growth.
                    However, COVID-19 will cause a transient increase in poverty in India before a sharp decline begins.
                    Less than 5 million individuals are expected to live below the $1.90 poverty threshold in India by
                    2030, thus ending the country's acute poverty. Only Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea, and North Korea
                    will likely achieve the target of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.</p>
