<h1>
  Combating Poverty Through Government-Aided Programs and Laws
</h1>
<h2> Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Programg</h2>
<p>
    The Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program, also known as 4Ps, is a government initiative that offers conditional cash handouts
    to the Philippines' most extreme cases of poverty. In order to give children aged 0 to 18 a better future, the program works
    to keep them healthy and in school. The government extended the program, which has been in place since 2007, in December 2016
    to include 20 million Filipinos, living in 4.4 million homes. The majority of the country's poor people—roughly 20% of the
    population—benefit from the program.
</p>
<p> Currently, the program helps 9 million kids, 1.9 million of them are secondary school students. For 4Ps households' elementary-aged
    children, enrollment in the program has likewise nearly reached 100%.

<h3>
    Rice Tariffication Law
</h3>
<p>
    The bill eliminated NFA's regulatory and importation activities and "tarifficated" QRs into regular customs taxes. The law establishes
    an annual Rice Fund as production support and other aid to rice farmers in an effort to lower the price of the nation's main food staple
    and to provide for any potential negative effects on palay growers.
</p>
<p>
    The Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund receives the rice tariffs collected from imports pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 11203, often
    known as the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) (RCEF). The Rice Farmer Financial Assistance, or RFFA, receives donations that are in excess of
    the P10 billion budget. It became a law on March 5, 2019.
</p>
<p>
    By contributing at least P10 billion year to the RCEF up until 2024, the RTL guarantees that farmers will directly benefit from the liberalization
    of the rice trading market.

<h4>
    Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act
</h4>
<p>
    In August 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act 10931, also known as the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act,
    giving impoverished Filipino students the chance to earn college degrees through free tuition and the exemption of other fees in SUCs. Additionally,
    it permits the Tertiary Education Subsidy, which finances the enrollment of underprivileged students at private institutions in areas without access
    to state or local universities and colleges.
</p>
<p>
    This initiative is an investment in the future of the Filipino family as well as our youth. This policy enables more Filipinos to enroll in technical
    or college-level courses, which should increase their access to work and other sources of support. Free tertiary education also frees up money that parents
    and breadwinners may otherwise spend on other necessities like housing and healthcare, or put more money up for savings.
