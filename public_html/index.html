                <h2>Types of Poverty</h2>
                <p>Imagine that the hub of a bicycle wheel represents a young girl living in a poor household in a rural area in the Caribbean or a young man with a disability living in a community of urban poor where the poverty rate exceeds 95 percent. Regardless of the scene, the hub of the bicycle wheel represents inequality and a life in which survival is a daily accomplishment.
                    Reaching out from the hub are the wheel's spokes. They represent our basic human needs and the different characteristics of poverty.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of issues in the world, but for poverty it is also experienced. Some experience hunger, illness, and poor sanitation are all causes and effects of poverty. Not being able to afford food is one way to say that you are poor, but being poor also means being unable to afford food or clean water. These problems or issues are often interrelated which means that not one problem occurs only once.</p>
