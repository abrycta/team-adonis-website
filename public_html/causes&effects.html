<h1>
  Cause and Effects of Poverty in the Philippines
</h1>
<h4> Inability to afford housing</h4>
<p>
  With poverty rife in the country and job opportunities scarce, many Filipinos are unable to afford housing,
  putting them at risk of sleeping on the streets. In the Philippines in 2012, extreme poverty affected 19.2
  percent of the population, or approximately 18.4 million people. This poverty line survived on $1.25 per day,
  making it extremely difficult for Filipinos and their families to rise out of poverty and find affordable housing
