            <h4>The Changes We Need</h4>
            <p> Most priorities of the government are misaligned with what the populace deserves. They expect the
                improvement of day-to-day living instead of potential threats to their own lives. The government's
                stance on prioritizing military strength over agriculture, education, and healthcare show that they want
                control and incentives. We as ambassadors of change feel compelled to connect with influential people in
                communities and governments worldwide. Together, we fight for sound change to help eradicate all facets
                of poverty in society. We create opportunities with public officials to voice our opinions about the
                laws, regulations, programs, and cultural norms that impact world poverty. We work to bring about
                justice and renewal in disadvantaged indigenous and local communities through these connections and
                sway.</p>
